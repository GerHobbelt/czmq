JNI Binding for CZMQ

## Building the JNI Layer for Linux

Ensure you have gradle and cmake installed, then run:

    gradle build jar
    gradle test

If you don't like to install gradle beforehand just use the gradle wrapper

    ./gradlew build jar
    ./gradlew test

This calls javah to build the headers in src/native/include, and then compiles the C and Java pieces to create a jar file a sharable library (.so).

## Building the JNI Layer for Android

See bindings/jni/android/build.sh.

You need the Android Native Development Kit (NDK) installed.

Set these environment variables, e.g:

    ANDROID_NDK_ROOT=$HOME/android-ndk-r10e
    TOOLCHAIN_VERSION=4.9
    TOOLCHAIN_HOST=arm-linux-androideabi
    TOOLCHAIN_NAME=$TOOLCHAIN_HOST-$TOOLCHAIN_VERSION
    TOOLCHAIN_ARCH=arm
    TOOLCHAIN_PATH=$ANDROID_NDK_ROOT/toolchains/$TOOLCHAIN_NAME/prebuilt/linux-x86_64/bin

Then in the android directory, run:

    ./build.sh

This does the following:

* It compiles the CZMQ C sources for Android, into a native library libczmq.so in builds/android/
* It compiles the JNI Java classes into a jar file czmq-jni-3.0.3.jar in bindings/jni/build/libs
* It compiles the JNI C sources for Android, into a native library libczmqjni.so.
* It combines all these into czmq-android.jar, which you can use in your Android projects.

## Building the JNI Layer for Windows

You need MS Visual Studio 2010 or later.

You need the Java SDK. Set the JAVA_HOME environment to the installation location, e.g. C:Program FilesJavajdk1.8.0_66.

1. Check out all dependent projects from github, at the same level as this project. E.g.: libzmq, czmq.
2. In each project, open a console in builds/msvc/vs2010 and run the build.bat batch file.
3. In this project, open a console in bindings/jni/msvc/vs2010 and run the build.bat batch file.

The resulting libraries (czmqjni.dll, czmqjni.lib) are created in bindings/jni/msvc/bin.

## Building the gradle wrapper (for maintainers)

The gradle wrapper is a tool that allows to use gradle on multiple platforms without installing it beforehand. As maintainers make sure you have gradle installed. Then just run

    gradle wrapper

Now commit all generated files to the project. Users will now be able to call the gradle wrapper which will install gradle for them.
